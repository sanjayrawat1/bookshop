#### Run application tests
`./gradlew test`

#### Run application
`./gradlew bootRun`

#### Running spring application as a container.
Package your application as a container image, using Cloud Native Buildpacks under the hood. Use below command:
`./gradlew bootBuildImage`

#### You can run the following command to get the details of the newly created image:
`docker images catalog-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`

#### Run the container image
`docker run --rm --name catalog-service -p 8080:8080 catalog-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`

##### Explanation of above command

|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| docker run                     | runs a container from an image                          |
| --rm                           | remove the container after its execution completes      |
| --name catalog-service         | name of the container                                   |

| catalog-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT | name and version of the image to run                    |
 

#### Managing containers with Kubernetes
Install minikube and setup kubernetes using below commands:

`brew install minikube`

`minikube start --driver=docker`

`minikube config set driver docker`

`brew install kubectl`

`kubectl get nodes`

`minikube stop`

`minikube start`

#### Useful Kubernetes CLI commands to manage Pods, Deployments, and Services.
| Kubernetes CLI command                                        | What it does                                                    |

| kubectl logs <pod_id>                                         | Show the logs for the given Pod.                                |
| kubectl delete deployment <name>                              | Delete the given Deployment.                                    |

| kubectl delete svc <service>                                  | Delete the given Service.                                       |
| kubectl port-forward svc <service> <host-port>:<cluster-port> | Forwards traffic from your local machine to within the cluster. | 

#### Running a Spring application on Kubernetes
First you need to tell Kubernetes to deploy Catalog Service from a container image. 
By default, minikube uses the Docker Hub registry to pull images, and it doesn't have access to your local ones.
Therefore, it will not find the image you built for the Catalog Service application. 
But donâ€™t worry: you can manually import it into your local cluster using below command: 

`minikube image load catalog-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`

#### The Kubernetes command to create a Deployment from a container image. Kubernetes will take care of creating Pods for the application
`kubectl create deployment catalog-service --image=catalog-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`

##### Explanation of above command
| command breakdown                      | description                      |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| kubectl create                         | create a kubernetes resource     |
| deployment                             | type of resource to create       |
| catalog-service                        | name of the deployment           |
| --image=catalog-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT | name and version of image to run |

#### Verify the creation of Deployment object
`kubectl get deployment`
Behind the scenes, k8s created a Pod for the application defined in the Deployment resource, verify the creation of the Pod object
`kubectl get pod`

#### The application running in k8s are not accessible, expose catalog-service to the cluster through a Service resource
#### The Kubernetes command to expose a Deployment as a Service. The Catalog Service application will be exposed to the cluster network through port 8080
`kubectl expose deployment catalog-service --name=catalog-service --port=8080`

##### Explanation of above command
| command breakdown      | description                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| kubectl expose         | expose a kubernetes resource                  |
| deployment             | type of resource to expose                    |
| catalog-service        | name of the deployment to expose              |
| --name=catalog-service | name of the service                           |
| --port=8080            | port number from which the service is exposed |

The Service object exposes the application to other components inside the cluster. Verify that it's been created correctly
`kubectl get service catalog-service`

#### Now forward the traffic from a local port on your computer (ex - 8000) to the port exposed by the Service inside the cluster (8080).
`kubectl port-forward service/catalog-service 8000:8080`

##### Explanation of above command
| command breakdown       | description                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| kubectl port-forward    | command for port forwarding |
| service/catalog-service | which resource to expose    |
| 8000                    | the port on your localhost  |
| 8080                    | the port of the Service     |

Now open the browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
