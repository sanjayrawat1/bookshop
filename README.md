An Online Bookshop

### Understanding the requirement

Books will be available for sale through the application. When a customer purchases a book, they should be able to check on the status of their order. 
Two categories of people will use the Bookshop application:

* Customers can browse books in the catalog, buy some, and check their orders.
* Employees can manage books, update existing ones, and add new items to the catalog.
