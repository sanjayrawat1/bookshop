### Managing Spring Boot containers with Docker Compose

Finally, you can remove the network you used to make catalog service communicate with postgres. You won't need it anymore, as you will use docker-compose to
manage the container life cycle. If you don't add any network configuration, docker compose will automatically create one for you and make all the containers
in the file join it. That means they can interact with each other through their container names, relying on docker's built-in DNS server.

`$ docker network rm catalog-network`
